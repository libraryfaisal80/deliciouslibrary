Overall Cron Jobs Algorithm:

Cron job 1:
Handler 1:
- Scan Cognito api(strip protected B)
- upload Congnito results to s3 (json format)
- call to export dynamo results in raw dynamo_json format through api and store results in (different s3 bucket)

1 hr later

Cron job 2:
Handler 2:
- Get list of files from (different s3 bucket) through api (delmit filter on .gz fromat)
- unzip .gz fromat and store results in runtime array 
- combine and format to json format
- remove PB (apply pattern)
- put to s3 bucket 
- clear raw dynamo_json from s3 bucket
- email
