                                                <br />
                                                Investors around the world recently learned that from 1980 through 2003 Warren Buffett’s arbitrage operations produced an astronomical average annualized rate of return of 81.28%. Even more amazing, this incredible rate of return was produced with very low rates of risk.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Long considered one of the most powerful and profitable of Buffett’s investment operations, but the least understood, these special types of investments have been the edge that made Warren Buffett so phenomenally successful. Warren Buffett and the Art of Stock Arbitrage is the first book to examine Buffett’s special brand of arbitrage investing.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Buffettologists Mary Buffett and David Clark explore the previously secret domain of Warren Buffett’s stock arbitrage investments. They explain how Buffett finds deals, evaluates them, picks the winners from the losers, and when he is willing to use leverage to help boost his performance in these investments to make amazing profits. Basic mathematical equations are included to help readers determine the projected rate of return, evaluate risk, and determine the probability of the deal being a success.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Buffett and Clark provide detailed explanations and examples of Warren Buffett’s methods for arbitrage, and for investing in tender offers, liquidations, spin-offs, and reorganizations. They take readers step by step from the initial public announcement to tendering shares, explaining how Buffett evaluates risk and maximizes his profit at every step.<br />

                                                 Warren Buffett and the Art of Stock Arbitrage is a valuable companion to the other books in Buffett and Clark’s successful series—Buffettology, The Buffettology Workbook, The New Buffettology, The Tao of Warren Buffett, Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements, and Warren Buffett’s Management Secrets.</span>

Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day — as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: "What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?"<br />

                                            <span class="description">Since its hardcover publication in August of 1995, Buffett has appeared on the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Seattle Times, Newsday and Business Week bestseller lists. The incredible landmark portrait of Warren Buffett's uniquely American life is now available in paperback, revised and updated by the author.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Starting from scratch, simply by picking stocks and companies for investment, Warren Buffett amassed one of the epochal fortunes of the twentieth century—an astounding net worth of $10 billion, and counting. His awesome investment record has made him a cult figure popularly known for his seeming contradictions: a billionaire who has a modest lifestyle, a phenomenally successful investor who eschews the revolving-door trading of modern Wall Street, a brilliant dealmaker who cultivates a homespun aura.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Journalist Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett's family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive, inside account of the life and career of this American original. Buffett  explains Buffett's' investment strategy—a long-term philosophy grounded in buying stock in companies that are undervalued on the market and hanging on until their worth invariably surfaces—and shows how it is a reflection of his inner self.</span>

They come to eat steak, buy furniture at a discount, and bask in the brilliance of value investor extraordinaire, Warren Buffet.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hedge fund founder, financial blogger, and professional skeptic Jeff Matthews got his own highly-coveted ticket to the Berkshire Hathaway meeting held only for shareholders and their guests—and proceeded to post reports on his blog, offering tempting glimpses into the much-discussed meeting. Now Matthews delivers a full-length account of his adventures at this infamous financial hoedown. In addition to offering a thoroughly entertaining first-hand account of Berkshire Hathaway's meeting, he answers questions investor's are asking, including: Does Buffett's famed penny-pinching cripple his companies?Why does Buffet—a bridge partner and best friend of Bill Gates—not own any technology stocks?How does the extremely rational Buffett square his well-known social progressiveness with his lily-white audience of investors?Is Buffet really an "Oracle"?What information, insights, and ideas do the meeting's attendees pick up-and how do they put this information to use in their own investments?Will Berkshire-Hathaway survive his death?<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Matthews also applies his financial acumen to harvesting potent lessons from his experiences that you can use as you survey the investment field, from finding how the world’s greatest investor evaluates not only businesses but the people who run them, to the importance of “just reading and thinking” and the value of having a smart, cynical partner. With the dispatches from this exclusive financial carnival, Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett's Omaha puts you at the forefront of an investor's dream come true.<br />

One of his favorite approaches-which is part classic value investing and part behavioral finance-is called "The Fallen Angels Investment Strategy," and it prepares investors to look past short-term value assumptions in order to capture profits. Throughout this book, Wisdom will show you how to capitalize on value plays where the fundamentals are actually strong, but the "general wisdom" surrounding the security has turned negative. He discusses how stocks with the most promise are ones that Wall Street has marked down without regard to their underlying value, and reveals how this type of intrinsic value discount provides a margin of safety during difficult times, and substantial upside rewards for those who find them early enough.Takes value investing one step further by mixing significant amounts of behavioral finance into the analysisPrepares investors to take advantage of other's mistakesA time-tested strategy for any type of market-up or down<br />
