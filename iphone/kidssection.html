Whether it's to gather food, build shelter or attract a mate, animals work in unexpected ways. Kids can try activities that demonstrate some surprising animal skills, like blowing bubbles the way a spittlebug does to hide itself from predators. Or mastering the half hitch and running knots that the weaverbird ties (with its feet!) when it builds a nest. Using concise language and realistic illustrations, this title in the Animal Behavior series takes a resourceful approach to exploring animal life.</span>

We are delighted to unveil its fresh new look for today's children, teachers and parents, with lively new covers and fresh artwork. Engaging new artwork and covers - Alex Brychta's unique style of artwork enthralls and entertains children, and the fresh new look will heighten their pleasure in reading the stories. With freshly drawn artwork for all the favorite core stories at Stages 2 - 5 and fantastic new covers, "Oxford Reading Tree" is more appealing than ever! Stories children love - The "Oxford Reading Tree" stories have always captivated children's imagination, inspiring them to read - and the stories and characters in the new editions haven't changed at all. Apart, that is, from an exciting new story at Stage 3, "The Egg Hunt", which replaces the "Dolphin Pool". Simplified structure - We have also simplified the structure of the scheme in response to feedback from you: "Owls" Storybooks become Stages 6 and 7 Storybooks; "Magpies" become Stages 8 and 9 Storybooks; "Wrens" at Stages 2 have become patterned stories at Stages 1+ and Stage 2; and "Wrens" at Stage 3 are now patterned stories at Stage 2. New teaching support material - In addition to the existing guided reading cards, perfect for use in guided reading sessions, we have brought out new teaching materials to reflect the needs of teachers in today's classroom: flexible, friendly teacher's notes included free with each pack of "Oxford Reading Tree" books - these are easy to store and will save you hours of preparation!; new Take-Home cards for every Storybook from Stages 1 - 9 to help parents or carers get the most out of reading with their child; free resources website with downloadable photocopy masters; and new "Teacher's Handbook" and special edition for Scotland.</span>

The book offers advice on what steps to take if the results are not what you expected. It also shows the role played by parents in their child's emotional and intellectual development and aims to help parents meet this challenge with confidence. "Test Your Child" sets out the ways parents may help their children to assume independence, increase imagination, overcome dislikes, foster sociability and seek individuality. It also looks at the various ways a child has of playing and discusses what toys and games to provide for your child. The book is designed to help parents to deal with problematic behaviour such as crying or tantrums in children up to five years old.</span>

Not only is he the first boy to ever beat Thomas in a brawl, but Caroline seems to like him, as well! Meanwhile, the heated anger between the Loyalists and the Patriots about to boil over. When the horses of the Patriots begin to disappear, it seems pretty obvious who's behind the thievery. Or is it? While on a picnic, Malcolm, Caroline, and Thomas encounter the masked rider in the woods, and it may cost Malcolm his life! Can Thomas save Malcolm before he bleeds to death? Who is the man behind the mysterious mask? Are some things just plain wrong no matter whose side you're on?<br />
