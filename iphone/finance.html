While traditionally stock exchanges have returned about 11 percent annually in the past half century, Buffett's investments have by nearly 29 percent a year, solidifying Buffett's conglomerate holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, as the eighth-largest business in the world and netting him $44 billion along the way.<br><br>Despite this tremendous success, “the Oracle of Omaha” remains modest. He acknowledges that he has a unique ability to evaluate businesses, but he doesn’t feel entitled to the vast wealth that ability has earned him. Instead, he likes to say that he was born at the right place and time. This humility in the face of proven talent and innumerable wealth is part of what makes Buffett universally popular—he is one of the world's wealthiest men and yet he is still personable and relatable.<br><br>For the first time, the most thought-provoking and inspiring quotes from Buffett are now compiled in a single book. The Oracle Speaks: Warren Buffett in His Own Words is a comprehensive guidebook to the inner workings of the Berkshire Hathaway chairman. Hundreds of Buffett's best quotes, comprising thoughts on investing, Wall Street, business, politics, taxes, and life lessons, will provide the most intimate and direct look into the mind of a modern business icon and give readers enough counsel to last a lifetime.<br><br>Media outlets, financial advisers, politicians, and Americans from Main Street to Wall Street hang on every word Buffett speaks, hoping to gain valuable insight into Buffett's investments and successes. There is possibly no greater stamp of approval in the business world than to have Buffett invest in a company, and few leaders in the course of history have commanded such universally agreed-upon respect. Even beyond his business savvy, Buffett is influential as a progressive thinker and active philanthropist, having pledged to give most of his money to charity through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as foundations run by his three children. It is this humility that consistently draws people to Buffett, and will draw people to The Oracle Speaks.<br><br>Most recently, inspired by Buffett's New York Times editorial in which he claimed he paid too little in taxes, President Barack Obama and Congress have named a series of tax reforms after Buffett. While the political implications have been controversial, Buffett has retained his reputation as an outspoken and successful business leader. The Oracle Speaks draws from decades of interviews, editorials, and annual shareholder reports, amassing the most complete outline of how Buffett believes a good business is run and a good life is led. It's advice that Buffett has successfully adhered to throughout his 80-plus years, and it is advice now available in the succinct, poignant, gift-friendly package of The Oracle Speaks.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/23F390BE-0C8A-4243-9F18-1248ACF7602E-140.png" width="90" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Complete Guide to Starting and Running a Bookshop</div><span class="creator">Booksellers Association</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0907972144</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/4FEA282C-9895-4C6B-871F-73EFF932538C-140.png" width="90" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Wolf of Wall Street: How Money Destroyed a Wall Street Superman</div><span class="creator">Jordan Belfort</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0340953756</span><span class="description">By day he made thousands of dollars a minute.

From the binge that sunk a 170-foot motor yacht, crashed a Gulfstream jet, and ran up a $700,000 hotel tab, to the wife and kids who waited for him for at home, and the fast-talking, hard-partying young stockbrokers who called him king and did his bidding, here, in his own inimitable words, is the story of the ill-fated genius they called... <br>THE WOLF OF WALL STREET <br>In the 1990s Jordan Belfort, former kingpin of the notorious investment firm Stratton Oakmont, became one of the most infamous names in American finance: a brilliant, conniving stock-chopper who led his merry mob on a wild ride out of the canyons of Wall Street and into a massive office on Long Island. In this astounding and hilarious tell-all autobiography, Belfort narrates a story of greed, power, and excess no one could invent - the story of an ordinary guy who went from hustling Italian ices at sixteen to making hundreds of millions.
