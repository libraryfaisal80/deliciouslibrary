In 2014, the company's online transactions totaled $248 billion—more than those of Amazon and eBay combined. The first Chinese entrepreneur to appear on the cover of Forbes, Ma is the now the second-richest man in China, with a net worth that is estimated to be north of $29 billion.<br><br>Despite Ma's massive influence in China and in the global tech world, his inspirational rags-to-riches story is relatively unknown to the general American public. Never Give Up: Jack Ma In His Own Words is a comprehensive guide to the inner workings of arguably the most prominent figure in the global tech world in the past 20 years—comprised entirely of Ma's own thought-provoking and candid quotes.<br><br>When Ma decided to start his first Internet company in 1999, few Chinese people knew what the Internet was. Ma, a former English teacher, knew nothing about coding, and his $20,000 in startup funds were not made up of investments from venture capitalists but loans from his family. He channeled his startup experience into Alibaba, a group of websites that allows businesses and people to connect in order to buy and sell products (similar to eBay and Amazon) while also collecting advertising revenue (similar to Google). By some measures, Alibaba is now the largest e-commerce site in the world.<br><br>In this book, more than 200 quotes on business values, innovation, entrepreneurship, competition, management, teamwork, life, and more provide an intimate and direct look into the mind of this modern business icon and philanthropist. Many of these quotes are translated directly from the Chinese press and interviews. For readers who do not read Chinese and have no other access to these materials, this book provides invaluable insight into the mind of one of the world's most successful business magnates.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/A7D543FE-3DFC-4E6E-A38F-F06CB541C417-140.png" width="90" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Oracle Speaks: Warren Buffett In His Own Words</div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1932841695</span><span class="description">From his office in Omaha, Nebraska, without even the benefit of a computer, Warren Buffett has racked up an investment record that far surpasses his counterparts on Wall Street—or anyone else in the world, for that matter. While traditionally stock exchanges have returned about 11 percent annually in the past half century, Buffett's investments have by nearly 29 percent a year, solidifying Buffett's conglomerate holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, as the eighth-largest business in the world and netting him $44 billion along the way.<br><br>Despite this tremendous success, “the Oracle of Omaha” remains modest. He acknowledges that he has a unique ability to evaluate businesses, but he doesn’t feel entitled to the vast wealth that ability has earned him. Instead, he likes to say that he was born at the right place and time. This humility in the face of proven talent and innumerable wealth is part of what makes Buffett universally popular—he is one of the world's wealthiest men and yet he is still personable and relatable.<br><br>For the first time, the most thought-provoking and inspiring quotes from Buffett are now compiled in a single book. The Oracle Speaks: Warren Buffett in His Own Words is a comprehensive guidebook to the inner workings of the Berkshire Hathaway chairman. Hundreds of Buffett's best quotes, comprising thoughts on investing, Wall Street, business, politics, taxes, and life lessons, will provide the most intimate and direct look into the mind of a modern business icon and give readers enough counsel to last a lifetime.<br><br>Media outlets, financial advisers, politicians, and Americans from Main Street to Wall Street hang on every word Buffett speaks, hoping to gain valuable insight into Buffett's investments and successes. There is possibly no greater stamp of approval in the business world than to have Buffett invest in a company, and few leaders in the course of history have commanded such universally agreed-upon respect. Even beyond his business savvy, Buffett is influential as a progressive thinker and active philanthropist, having pledged to give most of his money to charity through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as foundations run by his three children. It is this humility that consistently draws people to Buffett, and will draw people to The Oracle Speaks.<br><br>Most recently, inspired by Buffett's New York Times editorial in which he claimed he paid too little in taxes, President Barack Obama and Congress have named a series of tax reforms after Buffett. While the political implications have been controversial, Buffett has retained his reputation as an outspoken and successful business leader. The Oracle Speaks draws from decades of interviews, editorials, and annual shareholder reports, amassing the most complete outline of how Buffett believes a good business is run and a good life is led. It's advice that Buffett has successfully adhered to throughout his 80-plus years, and it is advice now available in the succinct, poignant, gift-friendly package of The Oracle Speaks.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/23F390BE-0C8A-4243-9F18-1248ACF7602E-140.png" width="90" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Daughter of the East: An Autobiography</div><span class="creator">Bhutto, Benazir</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1847390854</span><span class="description">Beautiful, charismatic, and the first and only woman to lead a post-colonial Muslim state, Benazir Bhutto achieved international renown in her native Pakistan until charges of corruption forced her into exile in the late 1990s. From her upbringing in one of Pakistan's richest families to her subsequent politicization and her arrest following her father's execution, Bhuttoâs autobiography chronicles a life of strength, dedication, and courage in the face of adversity. This updated volume addresses her personal and political activities over the past two decades and how her country has changed since being thrust into international limelight following 9/11. Intriguing and impassioned, this is the life story of one of the most prominent female politicians of the 20th century.<br></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/2EC14984-4AF4-43F9-8CC2-5C175AEEBD59-140.png" width="91" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Living History</div><span class="creator">Clinton, Hillary Rodham</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0743222253</span><span class="description">The Phenomenal #1 Worldwide Bestseller—With a New Afterword<br>Hillary Rodham Clinton is known to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Yet few beyond her close friends and family have ever heard her account of her extraordinary journey. She writes with candor, humor and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady.<br><br>Living History is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations and constant public scrutiny.<br><br>Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrain — responding to the changing times and her own internal compass — and became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate and international icon, she has lived through America's great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater.<br><br>The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families, and she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady and helped save the presidency from an unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment. Intimate, powerful and inspiring, Living History captures the essence of one of the most remarkable women of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voice — as a woman and as a formidable figure in American politics.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/85732794-DB15-4E19-9275-27681CA2B75D-140.png" width="94" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">I'll Do it My Way</div><span class="creator">Christina Daniels</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">9380069227</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/AC9C0624-CF00-47FC-9D88-46DAF76A8A51-140.png" width="98" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist</div><span class="creator">Lowenstein, Roger</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0385484917</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/950F682E-561D-45C7-8492-6D4AA2CB438E-140.png" width="95" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Osama</div><span class="creator">Randal, John</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">1845111176</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/408FDF34-DB66-499C-B25C-E5F7218FC403-140.png" width="98" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader</div><span class="creator">Schlender, Brent, Tetzeli, Rick</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0771079168</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/BE23E67A-32FB-4E9E-8464-BA5ECC5AED43-140.png" width="91" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</div><span class="creator">Schroeder, Alice</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">0553384619</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B9F0EC4C-16A6-412D-9AB7-D45EBB9C87FE-140.png" width="93" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Business Wisdom of Steve Jobs</div><span class="creator">Alan Ken Thomas</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">9350492180</span><span class="description"></span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D5C1C452-446C-4B4A-9726-72D4D8E8F950-140.png" width="90" height="140"></div></div></td>
