                                            <span class="description">The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success was a phenomenally successful book—more than 1,600,000 copies were sold—and as copies were passed between friends and loved ones, it touched millions more lives. Its author, Deepak Chopra, received thousands of letters from readers, many of whom expressed the desire to convey those same principles to their children, along with questions about how to do so.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                This book, The Seven Spiritual Laws for Parents, is Dr. Chopra's answer to those letters and to parents around the world who wish to raise children with values that satisfy spiritual needs as well as create the experience of abundance. After a general discussion of parenting and the gift of spirit, this book explores specific ways to practice the Seven Spiritual Laws as a family, how to convey these laws to children depending on their ages, and how to embody them in age-specific activities each day, beginning on Sundays with the Law of Pure Potentiality.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The Seven Spiritual Laws for Parents moves us beyond private triumphs and failures to experience the spiritual nature of communion with family, to share with those closest to us the infinite riches of innocence and love.</span>

Its emphasis on cultural context, integration of the diverse aspects of development, authoratitive presentation of competing theories, and scientific integrity combine to form a high standard of text. The second edition offers, greater accessibility, more balanced coverage, and new full-colour art, featuring photographs from a variety of cultures.

                                                Tom Sanders is an up-and-coming executive at the computer firm DigiCom. When his new boss turns out to be a woman who is both his former lover and a business rival, Sanders determines to be professional. But after a closed-door meeting, the woman accuses him of sexual harassment. It's her word against his, and suddenly Sanders finds himself caught in a nightmarish web of deceit in which he is branded as the villian. As he scrambles to save his career and his reputation, Sanders uncovers an electronic trail into DigiCom's secrets . . . and the cynical scheme devised to bring him down.</span>

Women who read it were astonished to find in its pages the hidden content of their own sexual fantasies. More outspoken, graphic, and taboo-shattering than any book before its time, My Secret Garden quickly became the classic study of female sexuality.

                                                <br />
                                                In the rain forests of Peru, an ancient manuscript has been discovered. Within its pages are 9 key insights into life itself — insights each human being is predicted to grasp sequentially; one insight, then another, as we move toward a completely spiritual culture on Earth. Drawing on ancient wisdom, it tells you how to make connections among the events happening in your life right now and lets you see what is going to happen to you in the years to come. The story it tells is a gripping one of adventure and discovery, but it is also a guidebook that has the power to crystallize your perceptions of why you are where you are in life and to direct your steps with a new energy and optimisim as you head into tomorrow.</span>
