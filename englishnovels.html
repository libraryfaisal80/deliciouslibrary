                                                <br />
                                                Composed in the twelfth century in northeastern Iran, Farid Attar’s great mystical poem is among the most significant of all works of Persian literature. A marvelous, allegorical rendering of the Islamic doctrine of Sufism, it describes the pilgrimage of the world’s birds in search of their ideal king, the Simorgh bird, and the arduous journey they take to reach him. This masterly translation preserves the poem’s rhymed couplet form and nuances of language.</span>

Sure, it hurts a little when you're compared to Nazi war criminals, but Nick says he's just doing what it takes to pay the mortgage and put his son through Washington's elite private school St. Euthanasius. He can handle the pressure from the antismoking zealots, but he is less certain about his new boss, BR, who questions whether Nick is worth $150,000 a year to fight a losing war. Under pressure to produce results, Nick goes on a PR offensive. But his heightened notoriety makes him a target for someone who wants to prove just how hazardous smoking can be. If Nick isn't careful, he's going to be stubbed out.</span>

                                            <span class="description">Born into one of Pakistan's most influential families, Tehmina Durrani was raised in the privileged milieu of Lahore high society and educated at the same school as Benazir Bhutto. Like all women of her rank, she was expected to marry a wealthy Muslim, bear him many children and lead a sheltered life of air-conditioned leisure. When she married Mustafa Khar, one of Pakistan's most eminent political figures, she continued to move in the best circles, and learned to keep up the public facade as a glamorous, cultivated wife, and mother of four children. In private, however, the story-book romance rapidly turned sour. Mustafa Khar became violently possessive and jealous, and succeeded in cutting his wife off from the outside world. For the course of her 14-year marriage, she suffered alone, in silence. This is the story of Tehmina's rebellion from an unhappy marriage. As a Muslim woman seeking a divorce, she paid a high price. She signed away all financial support, lost the custody of her children, and found herself alienated from her friends and disowned by her parents. The book, which she originally published herself after publishers in Pakistan refused to do so, shocked Pakistan society. She had succeeeded in reconciling her faith in Islam with her ardent belief in women's rights.</span>

Away from friends and family, they share a stretch of stained carpet with a group of strangers they call colleagues. There's Chris Yop, clinging to his ergonomic chair; Lynn Mason, the boss, whose breast cancer everyone pretends not to talk about; Carl Garbedian, secretly taking someone else's medication; Marcia Dwyer, whose hair is stuck in the eighties; and Benny, who's just - well, just Benny. Amidst the boredom, redundancies, water cooler moments, meetings, flirtations and pure rage, life is happening, to their great surprise, all around them. "Then We Came to the End" is about sitting all morning next to someone you cross the road to avoid at lunch. It's the story of your life and mine.</span>

                                            <span class="description">This book is about an ordinary person who became extra-ordinary not by doing different things, but by doing things differently. It is a description of a life journey that has had plenty of unexpected twists, turns, and rough terrain. This person had dogged determination to reach the summit. He crossed all the hurdles cheerfully and eventually succeeded. Abdulla Nass, the founder of Nass Group of companies, was born in Bahrain in a middle-class family. Story of his meteoric rise from a modest background is motivational and inspiring. Abdulla's life has one special dimension besides 'Success,' and that is 'Significance.' 'Significance' is much wider than 'Success.' It is a stage where one becomes more interested in service, in contributing to the welfare of the society and in searching real meaning of life and purpose of one's existence. In addition to being a biography, this book is also an exercise in modelling excellence and dynamic entrepeneurship, qualities that are hallmarks of Abdulla Nass. It looks 'beyond the visible and discernible.' The author talks about hierarchy of neurological levels and psychological factors that determine our beliefs, thought-processes and capabilities, which trigger certain behavioural patterns; in short, everything that effectively drives our destiny. The author has attempted to add value to the book by verbalising Abdulla's life practices and presenting them in a generalized form, which he calls 'GEMs,' or 'Guidelines for Entrepeneurs &amp; Managers.' These GEMs are answers to some of the common doubts confronted by Entrepeneurs and Managers in their careers. In a collective form, GEMs could therefore serve as a tool-kit for budding managers and entrepeneurs. Being successful need not be the 'end all and be all' of our lifes. In our journey, how we reach our destination is more important than reaching the destination itself. Abdulla's life story can serve as a guide and a road map in this endeavour.</span>

                                            <span class="description">How anyone can be more effective with less effort by learning how to identify and leverage the 80/20 principle—the well-known, unpublicized secret that 80 percent of all our results in business and in life stem from a mere 20 percent of our efforts.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The 80/20 principle is one of the great secrets of highly effective people and organizations.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Did you know, for example, that 20 percent of customers account for 80 percent of revenues? That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? The 80/20 Principle shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent that really counts. Although the 80/20 principle has long influenced today's business world, author Richard Koch reveals how the principle works and shows how we can use it in a systematic and practical way to vastly increase our effectiveness, and improve our careers and our companies.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The unspoken corollary to the 80/20 principle is that little of what we spend our time on actually counts. But by concentrating on those things that do, we can unlock the enormous potential of the magic 20 percent, and transform our effectiveness in our jobs, our careers, our businesses, and our lives.</span>

But when a string of ominous events — including a mysterious fire that kills her great-aunt and a furor in the Western art world raised by a dozen Breck family paintings — culminates in a threat to her life, Jill finally calls in a favor.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Zach Balfour works part-time as a consultant for St. Kilda. Though he’s got the skills to be a highly effective bodyguard, being a bullet catcher isn't his preferred way to spend time. But Jill is in deeper waters than she’s ever known, and she’ll need his protection; as she soon discovers, the perils of running wild rivers are tame compared with the hidden dangers in the high-stakes game of art collecting. Together, Zach and Jill must race against time to unmask a ruthless killer hidden in the blue smoke of money, threats, lies, and death. . . .</span>

                                                <br />
                                                President Francis Xavier Kennedy is elected to office, in large part, thanks to the legacy of his forebears–good looks, privilege, wealth–and is the very embodiment of youthful optimism. Too soon, however, he is beaten down by the political process and, disabused of his ideals, he becomes a leader totally unlike what he has been before.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                When his daughter becomes a pawn in a brutal terrorist plot, Kennedy, who has obsessively kept alive the memory of his uncles’ assassinations, activates all his power to retaliate in a series of violent measures. As the explosive events unfold, the world and those closest to him look on with both awe and horror.</span>

This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him. This edition contains a special Afterword by Rand's literary executor, Leonard Peikoff which includes excerpts from Ayn Rand's own notes on the making of The Fountainhead. As fresh today as it was then, here is a novel about a hero—and about those who try to destroy him.</span>

                                            <span class="description">Jillian Siegel is living the quintessential Manhattan life: great clothes, fabulous boyfriend, a job at the hottest ad agency in town. But what nobody knows is that this twenty-nine-year-old has a dark little secret — one that involves stuffing her oversize Gucci handbag with high-priced designer clothes and leaving the store without paying.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There was once a time when Jillian didn't need to shop (much less steal) to feel whole. But that was long ago — when her beloved uncle Bingo still owned Loevner's, the elegant Upper East Side department store. When, as a little girl, she spent hours listening to the wisdom of the perfume counter ladies and modeling party dresses for her uncle's impish partner, Alain; when she danced beneath Loevner's magnificent chandelier, found solace in the secret passageways behind its grand facade, and when her mother's prolonged absences were easily forgotten with a new camel-hair coat or a fresh pair of Mary Janes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                And then one day it was all gone. The department store family, the enchanted world, the endless abundance — pulled out from under her by her jet-setting mother, Lois; by the father she never knew; by the death of Alain, a cherished friend and confidant; and by the man with two first names who orchestrated the corporate takeover of her family's venerable sanctuary.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Now, years later, Jillian cannot seem to make things right no matter how many Chloé blouses come home in her pocketbook. Her "perfect" life is loosely held together with half milligrams of Ativan and stolen cashmere scarves. It's only a matter of time until everything crumbles.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Penned by one of advertising's most influential and provocative writers, this highly anticipated debut is packed with vibrant characters, bristling dialogue, and the rich detail of the author's real-life research into the clandestine world of shoplifting rings. The Booster is a uniquely stylish, deftly woven story about discovering one's true self in the most unexpected of places.</span>

                                            <span class="description">A compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world, John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" includes an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw in "Penguin Classics". Drifters in search of work, George and his childlike friend Lennie, have nothing in the world except the clothes on their back - and a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley, but their hopes are dashed as Lennie - struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy - becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes of friendship and shared vision, and giving a voice to America's lonely and dispossessed, "Of Mice and Men" remains Steinbeck's most popular work, achieving success as a novel, Broadway play and three acclaimed films. John Steinbeck (1902-68), winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for literature, is remembered as one of the greatest and best-loved American writers of the twentieth century. During the Second World War Steinbeck served as a war correspondent, his journalism later collected in "Once There Was a War" (1958), and he was awarded the Norwegian Cross of Freedom for his portrayal in "The Moon is Down" (1942) of Resistance efforts in northern Europe. His best-known works include the epics "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939) and "East of Eden" (1952), and his tragic novella "Of Mice and Men" (1937). John Steinbeck's complete works are published in "Penguin Modern Classics". If you enjoyed "Of Mice and Men", you might like Steinbeck's "Cannery Row", also available in "Penguin Modern Classics". "A thriller, a gripping tale that you will not set down until it is finished. Steinbeck has touched the quick". ("The New York Times").</span>
